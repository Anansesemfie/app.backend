                            The membership fee for the Anansesem Fie service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. 
                            The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed-up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. 
                            If you signed up for Anansesem Fie using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Anansesem Fie membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

                            You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. 
                            For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. 
                            Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
